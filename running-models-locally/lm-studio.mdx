### Recommended Model and Settings

For the best experience with CodinIT, use **Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct**. This model delivers strong coding performance and reliable tool use.

#### Critical Settings

After loading your model in the Developer tab, configure these settings:

1. **Context Length**: Set to 262,144 (the model's maximum)
2. **KV Cache Quantization**: Leave unchecked (critical for consistent performance)
3. **Flash Attention**: Enable if available (improves performance)

#### Quantization Guide

Choose quantization based on your RAM:

* **32GB RAM**: Use 4-bit quantization (\~17GB download)
* **64GB RAM**: Use 8-bit quantization (\~32GB download) for better quality
* **128GB+ RAM**: Consider full precision or larger models

#### Model Format

* **Mac (Apple Silicon)**: Use MLX format for optimized performance
* **Windows/Linux**: Use GGUF format

### Important Notes

* Start LM Studio before using with CodinIT
* Keep LM Studio running in background
* First model download may take several minutes depending on size
* Models are stored locally after download

### Troubleshooting

1. If CodinIT can't connect to LM Studio:
2. Verify LM Studio server is running (check Developer tab)
3. Ensure a model is loaded
4. Check your system meets hardware requirements
