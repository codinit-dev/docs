## Start your Project

There are several ways to get started with CodinIT, depending on your preferences and resources:

### Method 1: Using Prompts

CodinIT's prompt-based system makes app creation simple:

- **Describe what you want** to build in the prompt box
- **Be specific** - the more detailed you are, the better the results
- **Start with clear prompts** and refine as you go

::code-preview
---
class: "[&>div]:*:my-0"
---
**Example**: "Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart."

#code
```text
Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart.
```
::

### Method 2: Using Templates

::steps{level="4"}

#### Step 1: Choose Template

CodinIT offers templates to help you get started quickly on popular project types, such as dashboards, e-commerce sites, or social apps.

#### Step 2: Customize Template

Once the template loads, use prompts to adjust features, add new elements, or fine-tune the design to match your vision.

::

### Method 3: Remix an Existing Project

You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it.

::note
It is not possible to remix projects when Supabase is connected.

### Method 4: Using Figma

If you have a design in Figma:
