## Why This Matters

To help you make the most out of CodinIT, we've compiled the best prompting strategies from our team's experience and community feedback. Since CodinIT relies on AI to build your apps, knowing how to communicate clearly with AI can dramatically improve your results.

::callout{color="primary"}
**The key insight**: Better prompts lead to better apps. The difference between frustration and AI building entire workflows for you comes down to how you ask.

## What is Prompting?

Prompting is simply how you tell the AI what you want it to do. In CodinIT, prompts are your instructions for everything from creating a login page to building complex features. Think of it as having a conversation with a very capable assistant who needs clear directions to help you build amazing apps.

## Why Prompting Matters

Most people think prompting is just typing a request and hoping for the best – but there's so much more to it. Whether you're a developer or complete beginner, mastering AI communication in CodinIT helps you:

## Understanding How AI Thinks

AI doesn't "think" like humans – it predicts what comes next based on patterns. This means you need to be clear and specific to get good results.

### Key Communication Principles

::field-group
  :::field{name="Provide Context" type="principle"}
  AI has no background knowledge about your project unless you tell it. Always explain what you're building and why.
  :::

  :::field{name="Be Explicit" type="principle"}
  Don't assume the AI will guess what you want. If something is important, say it directly.
  :::

  :::field{name="Structure Matters" type="principle"}
  Put the most important information at the beginning of your prompt.
  :::

  :::field{name="Know the Limits" type="principle"}
  AI only knows what it was trained on. It can't browse the internet or know about your specific business rules unless you explain them.

## The C.L.E.A.R. Framework

Great prompts follow simple principles. Use **C.L.E.A.R.** as your checklist:

::steps{level="3"}

### C - Concise

Be clear and get to the point. Extra words can confuse the AI.

**❌ Bad**: "Could you maybe write something about a user system?"

**✅ Good**: "Create a user registration form with email, password, and a submit button."

### L - Logical

Organize your prompt in a step-by-step manner. Break complex requests into ordered steps.

**❌ Bad**: "Build me a user signup feature and also show some stats on usage."

**✅ Good**: "First, create a user sign-up form with email and password. Then, add a dashboard showing user count statistics."

### E - Explicit

State exactly what you want and don't want. If something is important, spell it out.

**❌ Bad**: "Make a form." (Too vague)

**✅ Good**: "Create a contact form with name, email, and message fields, plus a blue submit button."

### A - Adaptive

Don't settle for the first answer if it's not perfect. Use follow-up messages to refine the results.

**Example**: "Can you make that button larger and move it to the right side?"

### R - Reflective

Take time to notice what worked well in your prompts so you can use those patterns again.

## The Four Levels of Prompting

### Level 1: Structured Prompting (Best for Beginners)

Use a clear structure when starting or tackling complex tasks:

::tabs
  :::tabs-item{label="Template" icon="i-lucide-layout"}
  **Context**: What you're building
  **Task**: What you want to accomplish  
  **Guidelines**: How you want it done
  **Constraints**: What to avoid or requirements to meet
  :::

  :::tabs-item{label="Example" icon="i-lucide-lightbulb"}
  **Context**: "I'm building a recipe sharing app for home cooks"
  **Task**: "Create a page where users can add new recipes"
  **Guidelines**: "Use a clean, simple design with large text"
  **Constraints**: "Make it work on both phone and computer screens"
  :::
::

### Level 2: Conversational Prompting

As you get comfortable, write more naturally, like explaining to a friend:

::code-preview
---
class: "[&>div]:*:my-0"
---
"Let's add a feature to upload recipe photos. Users should be able to select an image file, see a preview, and save it with their recipe. Make sure to handle errors like files that are too large, and show a nice loading message while uploading."

#code
```text
Let's add a feature to upload recipe photos. Users should be able to select an image file, see a preview, and save it with their recipe. Make sure to handle errors like files that are too large, and show a nice loading message while uploading.
```
::

### Level 3: Meta Prompting (AI Helps Improve Your Prompts)

Ask the AI to help make your prompts better:

- "Review my last request and tell me how I could be more specific"
- "Rewrite this prompt to be clearer: 'Make a login page that's secure'"

### Level 4: Reverse Meta Prompting (Learning from Experience)

Use AI to document what you learned:

```
Summarize the problems we had setting up user authentication and how we fixed them. Then write a prompt I could use next time to avoid those issues.
```

## Prompting Techniques

### Basic vs. Example-Based Prompts

::tabs
  :::tabs-item{label="Basic Prompting" icon="i-lucide-message-circle"}
  Just ask for what you want with no examples:
  
  "Create a button that says 'Get Started' and is blue"
  :::

  :::tabs-item{label="Example-Based Prompting" icon="i-lucide-copy"}
  Show the AI exactly what you want with examples:
  
  "Create buttons like these examples:
  - 'Sign Up' → Blue background, white text
  - 'Log In' → White background, blue text
  
  Now make: 'Get Started' → ?"
  :::
::

### Getting Accurate Results

::steps{level="4"}

#### Use Your Knowledge Base

Always reference your project's Knowledge Base. Add project requirements, design guidelines, and technical details there.

#### Ask for Explanations

Add "and explain how it works" to understand what the AI is building.

#### Request Honesty

Include: "If you're not sure about something, tell me instead of guessing."

#### Double-Check Important Work

Ask: "Review that code and confirm it meets all the requirements."

## CodinIT-Specific Best Practices

### Start with Project Context

::card-group
  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-book-open
  title: Set Up Knowledge Base
  ---
  Include your app's purpose, target users, design preferences, and technical requirements
  :::

  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-search
  title: Reference Context
  ---
  Start prompts with: "Based on the project Knowledge Base, create..."
  :::
::

### Be Specific, Avoid Vagueness

**❌ Don't say:**
- "Make this app better"
- "Create a form"
- "Add some features"

**✅ Do say:**
- "Improve the app's loading speed without changing how it looks"
- "Create a user registration form with email, password, and a 'Sign Up' button"
- "Add a search feature that filters recipes by ingredient"

### Build Step by Step

Break your development into logical steps:

::steps{level="4"}

#### Step 1: Foundation

"Set up a basic recipe app with a homepage and navigation"

#### Step 2: Core Features

"Great! Now add the ability for users to create accounts and log in"

#### Step 3: Main Functionality

"Perfect! Now let's add a page where users can submit new recipes"

#### Step 4: Polish

"Excellent! Can you improve the design and make it mobile-friendly?"

::

### Use CodinIT's Modes Effectively

::tabs
  :::tabs-item{label="Chat Mode" icon="i-lucide-message-circle"}
  **Use for**: Planning, discussing ideas, debugging problems
  
  **Example**: "I want to add a rating system to my recipe app. What's the best way to structure this?"
  :::

  :::tabs-item{label="Build Mode" icon="i-lucide-hammer"}
  **Use for**: Actually creating and modifying your app
  
  **Example**: "Create a 5-star rating component and add it to the recipe page based on our discussion above"
  :::
::

### Include Clear Requirements

Always spell out what you need:

::code-preview
---
class: "[&>div]:*:my-0"
---
"Create a recipe search feature that:
- Lets users type ingredients they have
- Shows recipes that use those ingredients  
- Works on both phone and desktop
- Displays results in a grid layout
- Limits results to 12 per page"

#code
```text
Create a recipe search feature that:
- Lets users type ingredients they have
- Shows recipes that use those ingredients  
- Works on both phone and desktop
- Displays results in a grid layout
- Limits results to 12 per page
```
::

### Use Images Effectively

CodinIT lets you upload images with your prompts:

**Simple approach:**
```
Create a page that looks like this image
```

**Detailed approach:**
```
Looking at this screenshot, I want to recreate this recipe card design:
- Photo at the top
- Recipe title below the photo
- Cooking time and difficulty on the bottom
- Clean, minimal styling
- Works well on mobile screens
```

## Advanced Tips

### Precise Editing Instructions

Focus the AI on specific parts:

```
In the recipe card component, change the 'Cook' button to say 'Start Cooking' and make it green instead of blue. Don't change anything else about the card.
```

### Design and Visual Changes

For appearance updates:
```
Make the recipe title text larger and bold, but don't change any of the functionality or click behaviors.
```

For mobile optimization:
```
Make the recipe grid work better on phones: stack the cards vertically and make them full width on small screens.
```

### Debugging with AI Help

::steps{level="4"}

#### Provide Error Details

Copy error messages and explain what's happening: "Here's the error I'm getting when users try to upload photos. What's wrong and how do we fix it?"

#### Use Follow-Up Questions

If the first fix doesn't work: "That didn't solve it. The upload still fails. What else could be causing this?"

#### Chat Through Problems

Use Chat Mode to discuss: "Let's think through why the login might not be working" and have a back-and-forth conversation.

## When to Use (and Not Use) AI

### ✅ Use AI for:

::card-group
  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-puzzle
  title: Complex Features
  ---
  Multi-step operations, new functionality, things you're unsure about
  :::

  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-copy
  title: Repetitive Tasks
  ---
  Creating similar components, boilerplate code, structured content
  :::

  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-lightbulb
  title: Learning
  ---
  Understanding how something works, exploring different approaches
  :::

  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-wrench
  title: Problem Solving
  ---
  Debugging issues, figuring out why something isn't working
  :::
::

### ❌ Don't use AI for:

- Extremely small changes (changing one word, adjusting colors slightly)
- Simple fixes you can do quickly yourself
- When you're running low on credits and it's not worth it

## Common Prompting Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Being Too Vague

**❌ Bad**: "Make it look better"
**✅ Good**: "Make the text larger, add more space between elements, and use our brand colors (blue and white)"

### Mistake 2: Asking for Everything at Once

**❌ Bad**: "Build a complete social media app with posts, comments, likes, user profiles, messaging, and notifications"
**✅ Good**: "Let's start with a basic post creation feature where users can write text posts and see them in a feed"

### Mistake 3: Not Providing Context

**❌ Bad**: "Add authentication"
**✅ Good**: "Add user authentication to my recipe app using email/password login, so users can save their favorite recipes"

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Follow-Up Opportunities

**❌ Bad**: Getting a result that's close but not perfect and starting over
**✅ Good**: "That's great! Can you adjust the styling to match our color scheme and make the button slightly larger?"
