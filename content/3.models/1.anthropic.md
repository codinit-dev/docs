## Extended Thinking

Anthropic models offer an "Extended Thinking" feature, designed to give them enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. This feature allows the model to output its step-by-step thought process before delivering a final answer, providing transparency and enabling more thorough analysis for challenging prompts.

::callout{color="green"}
When extended thinking is enabled in CodinIT, the model generates `thinking` content blocks that detail its internal reasoning. These insights are then incorporated into its final response.
::

CodinIT users can leverage this by checking the `Enable Extended Thinking` box below the model selection menu after selecting a Claude Model from any provider.

### Key Aspects of Extended Thinking

::field-group
  :::field{name="Supported Models" type="feature"}
  Available for select models, including variants of Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Models with the `:thinking` suffix are pre-configured in CodinIT.
  :::

  :::field{name="Summarized Thinking (Claude 4)" type="feature"}
  For Claude 4 models, the API returns a summary of the full thinking process to balance insight with efficiency. You are billed for the full thinking tokens, not just the summary.
  :::

  :::field{name="Streaming" type="feature"}
  Extended thinking responses, including the `thinking` blocks, can be streamed.
  :::

  :::field{name="Tool Use & Prompt Caching" type="feature"}
  Extended thinking interacts with tool use and prompt caching with specific behaviors around cache invalidation and context.
  :::

::tip
For comprehensive details on how extended thinking works, including API examples, interaction with tool use, prompt caching, and pricing, please refer to the [official Anthropic documentation on Extended Thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
