The Code Editor is where you write your code. It's like a super-smart text editor that understands programming and helps you write better code.

## What is the Code Editor?

Think of the Code Editor as a special notebook for writing code. It colors your code to make it easier to read and helps you find mistakes.

## Main Parts

### Finding Your Files

On the left side, you'll see all your project files organized like folders on your computer:
- Click folders to open them and see what's inside
- Click files to open and edit them
- Icons show you what type of file it is (JavaScript, image, etc.)
- A dot appears next to files you've changed but haven't saved

### Writing Code

The big area in the middle is where you write your code:
- **Colors** - Different parts of your code show up in different colors to make it easier to read
- **Suggestions** - As you type, the editor suggests what you might want to write next
- **Find and replace** - Search for words in your code and change them
- **Multiple spots** - Edit several places at once

### Using the Terminal

At the bottom, you can open a terminal to run commands:
- Open multiple terminal tabs for different tasks
- Make it bigger or smaller by dragging
- See commands you ran before
- Run commands without leaving your code

## What You Can Do With Files

You can manage your files in many ways:
- **Create** - Make new files and folders
- **Delete** - Remove files you don't need
- **Rename** - Change file names
- **Upload** - Drag files from your computer into the editor
- **Search** - Find files quickly by name

### Reviewing AI Changes

When the AI wants to change your files, you can review the changes first:
- **See the differences** - Compare the old and new versions side by side
- **Approve or reject** - Choose which changes to keep
- **Colored highlights** - See exactly what's being added or removed
