The Terminal is like a text-based remote control for your project. Instead of clicking buttons, you type commands to tell your computer what to do.

## What is the Terminal?

Think of the Terminal as a way to talk directly to your computer using text commands. It's like texting your computer to ask it to do things.

## What Can You Do?

### Running Commands

You can type commands to:
- Start your app so you can see it working
- Install new tools and libraries
- Check if your code has any problems
- Save your work to GitHub

### Common Commands

Here are some commands you might use:
- `npm install` - Download tools your project needs
- `npm start` - Start your app
- `npm test` - Check if everything works correctly
- `git status` - See what files you've changed

### Using Multiple Terminals

You can open several terminal tabs at once, like having multiple conversations:
- One tab runs your app
- Another tab runs tests
- A third tab is ready for quick commands

This way, you don't have to stop one thing to do another.

- **Command history** - Press the up arrow to see commands you typed before
