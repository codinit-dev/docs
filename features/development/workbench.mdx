description: Your complete workspace for building apps - write code, see it work, and track changes
---

The Workbench is your main workspace in CodinIT. It's where you write code, see your app running, and check what you've changed.

## What is the Workbench?

Think of the Workbench as your desk where you have everything you need to build an app. You can write code, test it, and see what's different from before - all in one place.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Code View" icon="code" href="#code-view">

## Three Main Views

The workbench has three different views. You can switch between them depending on what you want to do:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Code View">
    ## Writing Code

    This is where you write and organize your code files.

    ### Your Files

    On the left, you see all your project files in a tree:
    - Click folders to open them
    - Click files to edit them
    - Icons show what type of file it is
    - A dot shows files you haven't saved yet

    <Callout type="info">
      **Quick Tip**: Use the search box to find files by name.
    </Callout>

    ### The Editor

    The big area in the middle is where you write code:
    - **Colors** - Your code is colored to make it easier to read
    - **Suggestions** - Get help as you type
    - **Find and replace** - Search for text and change it
    - **Edit multiple spots** - Change several places at once

    You can save your work or undo changes with the buttons at the top.

    ### Search Everything

    Need to find something in your whole project?
    - Type what you're looking for
    - See results from all files
    - Click a result to jump to that file

    ### Terminal

    At the bottom, you can type commands:
    - Open multiple terminal tabs
    - Make it bigger or smaller
    - Run commands to start your app or install tools

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Preview View">
    ## See Your App Running

    This view shows your app working, just like it would on a real phone, tablet, or computer.

    ### Live Preview

    Watch your app in action:
    - **Instant updates** - See changes as soon as you save your code
    - **Click and test** - Try buttons and forms to make sure they work
    - **See errors** - If something breaks, you'll see what went wrong

    ### Test on Different Devices

    Make sure your app looks good everywhere:

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="📱 Phones" icon="mobile">
            iPhone and Android phones of different sizes
          </Card>
          <Card title="📱 Tablets" icon="tablet">
            iPads and other tablets
          </Card>

    You can also flip devices sideways (landscape) or upright (portrait) to test both ways.

    ### Change the Size

    You can adjust the preview size:
    - Pick a device from the list
    - Drag the edges to make it bigger or smaller
    - Type in exact sizes if you need to

    ### Take Screenshots

    - Save it to share with others
    - Add notes or highlights if needed

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Changes View">
    ## See What You Changed
