title: Workbench
description: Your complete workspace for building apps - write code, see it work, and track changes
---

The Workbench is your main workspace in CodinIT. It's where you write code, see your app running, and check what you've changed.

## What is the Workbench?

Think of the Workbench as your desk where you have everything you need to build an app. You can write code, test it, and see what's different from before - all in one place.
