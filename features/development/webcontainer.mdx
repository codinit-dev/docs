WebContainer lets you run your app and see it working. If your app has multiple parts (like a website and a backend), you can easily switch between them.

## What is WebContainer?

Think of WebContainer like a mini computer inside CodinIT. It runs your code and shows you what it looks like, just like opening a website in your browser.

## How to Use It

### Switching Between Parts

When your app is running, you might see different "ports" (think of them as different doors to your app). You can click a dropdown to switch between them.

- Click the port number to see all available parts
- Select the one you want to view
- Your preview updates instantly

### When You Need Multiple Parts

Some apps have different pieces that work together:

- **Website** - What users see and click on
- **Backend** - The part that handles data and logic
- **Tools** - Extra helpers for testing or building

You can view each part separately to make sure everything works correctly.

### Navigating Your App

Once you pick a part to view:
- Type URLs in the address bar to visit different pages
- Click the refresh button to reload
- Open in a new tab to see it in your regular browser

  **Easy Switching**: CodinIT automatically finds all the running parts of your app. Just pick the one you want to see from the dropdown menu.
