## Start building with AI code generation in three steps

Launch your AI-powered IDE and create full-stack applications with intelligent AI coding assistance, automated code completion, and LLM-powered development tools.

Step 1: Set up your development environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Install CodinIT">
    **Desktop App Version (Recommended)**

    Download the latest prebuilt release for macOS, Windows, and Linux:
    - Visit [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/codinit-dev/codinit-dev/releases/latest)
    - Download the installer for your platform
    - Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
    - Full-featured native application with automatic updates

    **Alternative: Run from Source**

    Clone the repository and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codinit-dev/codinit-dev.git
    cd codinit-dev
    ```

    Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm install
    ```

    ```bash npm
    npm install
    ```

    Configure your environment by creating a `.env` file and adding your preferred AI provider keys:

    ```bash
    # Create .env file with your AI provider API keys
    # You can mix and match multiple providers
    ```

    Run the development server:

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    ```bash npm
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

    <Tip>Choose the desktop app for a native experience or run from source for development and customization.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="play" title="Launch CodinIT">
    1. Open the CodinIT application
    2. Create your workspace (local folder or Git repository)
    3. The development environment loads automatically

    <Tip>Your workspace is ready when you see the file explorer, terminal, and code editor.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Connect AI model providers (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Get AI model API keys for code generation">
    Sign up for LLM provider accounts and obtain API keys for AI-powered coding:

    **Essential AI coding models (Free tiers available)**
    - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) - GPT-4o, GPT-4 for AI code generation
    - [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) - Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI coding assistant
    - [Google AI](https://aistudio.google.com) - Gemini 2.0 Flash for intelligent code completion

    **Optional AI development providers**
    - [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com) - Cost-effective AI coding models
    - [Groq](https://console.groq.com) - Fast LLM inference for real-time coding
    - [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai) - Research-focused AI models

    <Warning>Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="plug" title="Configure AI models in CodinIT IDE">
    1. Click **Settings** in the AI coding assistant interface
    2. Navigate to **AI Providers** section for LLM configuration
    3. Add your API keys for Claude, GPT-4, or other AI models
    4. Test AI connections and select default coding models
    5. Start using AI code generation and intelligent autocomplete immediately!

    <Tip>Use multiple AI providers simultaneously and switch between LLMs for optimal code generation results.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Create your first AI-generated project

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="plus" title="Start a new AI-powered project">
    Create full-stack applications with AI code generation:

    1. Click **New Project** in the AI development workspace
    2. Choose your tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, Next.js, etc.)
    3. Select an AI-optimized template or start from scratch
    4. AI coding assistant generates boilerplate code and project structure

    <Tip>Use natural language prompts or voice commands to describe your app - AI will generate production-ready code!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="sparkles" title="Use AI coding features">
    Explore CodinIT's AI-powered development capabilities:

    - **AI code generation**: Describe features in natural language for instant code creation
    - **Intelligent autocomplete**: Get context-aware AI code suggestions
    - **AI debugging & fixes**: Automatic bug detection and AI-powered solutions
    - **AI documentation**: Auto-generate README files and API documentation
    - **AI test generation**: Create unit tests and integration tests with AI assistance

    <Note>Use Ctrl+Space (or Cmd+Space on Mac) to trigger AI code completions anywhere in your development environment.</Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
