## LLM provider issues for AI coding

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid AI model API key errors" icon="key">
    **Problem**: Getting "Invalid API key" or "Authentication failed" errors with LLM providers for AI code generation.

    **Solutions**:

    1. **Check LLM API key format**: Ensure you're copying the complete key from your AI provider dashboard
    2. **Verify AI key permissions**: Some LLM providers require specific permissions for code generation API access
    3. **Check key expiration**: Some AI API keys have expiration dates or usage limits
    4. **Test in provider dashboard**: Verify your LLM key works directly with the AI provider

    **AI provider-specific tips**:

    - **OpenAI GPT models**: Keys start with `sk-` and are found in [API Keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
    - **Anthropic Claude**: Keys start with `sk-ant-` and require console access for AI coding
    - **Google Gemini**: Keys are 39 characters and need Gemini API enabled for code generation

    <Warning>
      Never share your API keys publicly or commit them to version control.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Rate limit exceeded" icon="clock">
    **Problem**: Hitting API rate limits or quota exceeded errors.

    **Solutions**:

    1. **Check your usage**: Monitor your account usage in the provider dashboard
    2. **Upgrade your plan**: Consider a higher-tier plan for more usage
    3. **Implement retry logic**: Add delays between API calls
    4. **Switch providers**: Use alternative providers when one hits limits
    5. **Use local models**: Consider Ollama for unlimited local inference

    <Tip>
      Set up multiple providers as fallbacks to avoid workflow interruption.
