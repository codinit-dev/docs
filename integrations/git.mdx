## Working with GitHub

### What You Can Do

CodinIT can do these Git things for you:

**Basic operations:**

- Copy projects from GitHub
- Create and switch branches
- Save and upload changes
- Fix conflicts when they happen
- Check what changed

**Example commands:**

```bash
# Copy a project
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Make a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Upload your changes
git push origin main
```

### Security

**How you log in:**

- Personal Access Tokens (a special password)
- SSH keys (a secure key file)
- OAuth (log in with GitHub)
- Permission for specific projects

**Staying safe:**

- Commands are checked for safety
- Limits to prevent abuse
- Records of what you do
- Secure password storage

## Starting from Templates

### Use Pre-Made Projects

Start quickly with ready-made project templates:

**Types of templates:**

- Website frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Backend APIs (Express, FastAPI, NestJS)
- Complete apps (frontend + backend)
- Mobile app starters
- Deployment setups

**How to use a template:**

```typescript
// Start from a template
const template = await fetch('/api/github-template', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    template: 'facebook/react',
    name: 'my-react-app',
  }),
});
```

### Make Your Own Templates

**Creating templates:**

- Turn your project into a template
- Set up variables and settings
- Add setup scripts
- Include instructions

**Template folder structure:**

```
template-repo/
├── template.json      # Settings
├── setup.js          # Setup script
├── README.md         # Instructions
└── src/              # Your code
```

## Repository Management

### Creating New Repositories

**From Existing Projects:**

```typescript
// API endpoint for repository creation
POST /api/github-template
{
  "action": "create-repo",
  "name": "my-new-project",
  "private": false,
  "description": "Project created with CodinIT"
}
```

**Repository Configuration:**

- **Visibility**: Public or private repositories
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch protection rules
- **Collaborators**: Team member access management
- **Topics and Labels**: Organization and categorization
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD workflows

### Importing Existing Repositories

**Supported Import Methods:**

- Direct GitHub repository URLs
- GitHub organization repositories
- Private repository access
- Large repository handling

**Import Process:**

```typescript
// Repository import via API
const importResult = await fetch('/api/git-proxy/import', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://github.com/user/repo.git',
    branch: 'main',
    depth: 1, // Shallow clone for large repos
  }),
});
```

**Post-Import Setup:**

- Dependency installation
- Environment configuration
- Build verification
- Development server startup

### Repository Synchronization

**Bidirectional Sync:**

- Automatic commit creation on file changes
- Pull request synchronization
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Branch status monitoring

**Sync Configuration:**

```json
{
  "sync": {
    "autoCommit": true,
    "pullInterval": 30000,
    "conflictStrategy": "manual",
    "ignorePatterns": [".env", "node_modules"]
  }
}
```

## Advanced Git Operations

### Branch Management

**Creating and Managing Branches:**

```bash
# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Switch between branches
git checkout main
git checkout feature/user-authentication

# Merge branches
git merge feature/user-authentication
```

**Branch Protection Rules:**

- Required pull request reviews
- Required status checks
- Restrictions on force pushes
- Branch naming conventions

### Commit Strategies

**Atomic Commits:**

- Each commit represents one logical change
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Related changes grouped together
- Easy to understand and revert

**Commit Message Conventions:**

```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve login form validation bug
docs: update API documentation
refactor: simplify user state management
```

### Conflict Resolution

**Handling Merge Conflicts:**

```bash
# Check for conflicts
git status

# Resolve conflicts in files
# Then add resolved files
git add resolved-file.js

# Complete the merge
git commit
```

**Prevention Strategies:**

- Regular branch synchronization
- Clear ownership of code areas
- Code review requirements
- Automated testing before merges

## Git Hooks and Automation

### Pre-commit Quality Checks

**Automated Validation:**

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run type-check
```

**Code Quality Gates:**

- ESLint for code style
- Prettier for formatting
- TypeScript type checking
- Unit test execution

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions Workflows:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
```

**Deployment Automation:**

- Automatic preview deployments
- Production deployment on merge
- Rollback capabilities
- Environment-specific configurations

## Best Practices

### Repository Organization

**Branch Strategy:**

- `main`/`master`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*`: Critical bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

**Commit Hygiene:**

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use conventional commit format
- Squash related commits before merging

### Collaboration Workflows

**Code Review Process:**

- Create feature branches for all changes
- Submit pull requests for review
- Require approvals before merging
- Use automated checks and tests

**Team Coordination:**

- Regular branch synchronization
- Clear ownership of code areas
- Documentation of processes
- Regular team communication

## Branching and merging

When you create or import a repository in CodinIT, you’ll start on the **main** branch. This is usually the live version of your project. You can do all your work on main, or create branches.

Branches allow you to:

- Work with others without overwriting each other’s changes.
- Work on different features separately, so unfinished work doesn’t go live.

  <Info>
    For example, if you’re building three new features on the main branch, you’d have to finish all three before
    publishing. With branches, you can finish and merge each one into main as they're ready.
  </Info>

### Create a new branch in CodinIT

<Info>Prerequisite: You must have GitHub connected to CodinIT and a repository already created.</Info>

1. Log in to CodinIT and open a project that is already linked to a GitHub repository.
2. Click the GitHub icon in the top-right of your screen.
3. Click **Create new branch**.
4. Enter a branch name.
5. Click **Create branch**.

<Check>You're now working on your new branch, which is also created in your GitHub repository.</Check>

### Change branches in CodinIT

<Info>
  Prerequisite: You must have GitHub connected to CodinIT, a repository already created, and multiple branches created.
</Info>

1. Log in to CodinIT and open a project that is already linked to a GitHub repository.
2. Click the GitHub icon in the top-right of your screen.
3. Select the branch you want to switch to.

<Tip>CodinIT currently doesn't support merging branches in-app. You need to merge branches in GitHub.</Tip>

### Committing and fetching

CodinIT saves your work automatically. Every time you make a change that doesn’t break the project, CodinIT creates a commit for you.

It also checks GitHub every 30 seconds for any updates made outside CodinIT and pulls those in.

<Warning>
  Very rarely, both CodinIT and GitHub might update at almost the same time. If that happens, CodinIT will keep your
  changes and overwrite the GitHub version.
</Warning>
