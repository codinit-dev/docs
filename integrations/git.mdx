CodinIT connects to GitHub so you can save your code online, work with others, and keep track of changes.

## What Can You Do?

CodinIT helps you with GitHub in several ways:

## Working with GitHub

### What You Can Do

CodinIT can do these Git things for you:

**Basic operations:**

- Copy projects from GitHub
- Create and switch branches
- Save and upload changes
- Fix conflicts when they happen
- Check what changed

**Example commands:**

```bash
# Copy a project
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Make a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Upload your changes
git push origin main
```

### Security

**How you log in:**

- Personal Access Tokens (a special password)
- SSH keys (a secure key file)
- OAuth (log in with GitHub)
- Permission for specific projects

**Staying safe:**

- Commands are checked for safety
- Limits to prevent abuse
- Records of what you do
- Secure password storage

## Starting from Templates

### Use Pre-Made Projects

Start quickly with ready-made project templates:

**Types of templates:**

- Website frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Backend APIs (Express, FastAPI, NestJS)
- Complete apps (frontend + backend)
- Mobile app starters
- Deployment setups

**How to use a template:**

```typescript
// Start from a template
const template = await fetch('/api/github-template', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    template: 'facebook/react',
    name: 'my-react-app',
  }),
});
```

### Make Your Own Templates

**Creating templates:**

- Turn your project into a template
- Set up variables and settings
- Add setup scripts
- Include instructions

**Template folder structure:**

```
template-repo/
├── template.json      # Settings
├── setup.js          # Setup script
├── README.md         # Instructions
└── src/              # Your code
```

## Managing Your Projects

### Creating New Projects

**Start a new project:**

You can create a new GitHub repository right from CodinIT:
- Choose public (anyone can see) or private (only you can see)
- Add a description
- Set up protection rules
- Add team members
- Set up automatic testing

### Bringing in Existing Projects

**Import from GitHub:**

You can bring in projects you already have on GitHub:
- Paste the GitHub URL
- Choose which branch to use
- CodinIT will download it and set it up

After importing:
- Install needed tools
- Set up settings
- Make sure it builds correctly
- Start the development server

### Keeping Things in Sync

**Automatic syncing:**

CodinIT keeps your code in sync with GitHub:
- Saves changes automatically
- Checks for updates every 30 seconds
- Helps fix conflicts
- Watches branch status

    ### Git is Slow

    **Common problems:**
    - Big projects take forever to download
    - Running out of memory
    - Slow internet
    - Not enough disk space

    **How to fix:**
    - Use shallow clones (download less history)

## Good Habits

### Organizing Your Code

**Branch names:**

- `main`: The working version
- `develop`: Where you combine new features
- `feature/*`: New features you're building
- `hotfix/*`: Quick fixes for urgent bugs
- `release/*`: Getting ready to release

**Commit messages:**

- Write clear messages about what you changed
- Keep each commit focused on one thing
- Use a standard format
- Combine related commits before merging

### Working with Others

**Code review:**

- Make a branch for each change
- Ask others to review your code
- Get approval before merging
- Use automatic tests

**Team coordination:**

- Sync branches regularly
- Know who's working on what
- Write down your processes
- Talk to your team often

## Branching and merging

When you create or import a repository in CodinIT, you’ll start on the **main** branch. This is usually the live version of your project. You can do all your work on main, or create branches.

Branches allow you to:

- Work with others without overwriting each other’s changes.
- Work on different features separately, so unfinished work doesn’t go live.

  <Info>
    For example, if you’re building three new features on the main branch, you’d have to finish all three before
    publishing. With branches, you can finish and merge each one into main as they're ready.
  </Info>

### Create a new branch in CodinIT

<Info>Prerequisite: You must have GitHub connected to CodinIT and a repository already created.</Info>

1. Log in to CodinIT and open a project that is already linked to a GitHub repository.
2. Click the GitHub icon in the top-right of your screen.
3. Click **Create new branch**.
4. Enter a branch name.
5. Click **Create branch**.

<Check>You're now working on your new branch, which is also created in your GitHub repository.</Check>

### Change branches in CodinIT

<Info>
  Prerequisite: You must have GitHub connected to CodinIT, a repository already created, and multiple branches created.
</Info>

1. Log in to CodinIT and open a project that is already linked to a GitHub repository.
2. Click the GitHub icon in the top-right of your screen.
3. Select the branch you want to switch to.

<Tip>CodinIT currently doesn't support merging branches in-app. You need to merge branches in GitHub.</Tip>

### Committing and fetching

CodinIT saves your work automatically. Every time you make a change that doesn’t break the project, CodinIT creates a commit for you.

It also checks GitHub every 30 seconds for any updates made outside CodinIT and pulls those in.

<Warning>
  Very rarely, both CodinIT and GitHub might update at almost the same time. If that happens, CodinIT will keep your
  changes and overwrite the GitHub version.
</Warning>
