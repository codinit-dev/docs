> If you published a CodinIT project before August 14, 2025, it was deployed through Netlify, not CodinIT hosting. You can now choose which hosting service you’d like to use.

For your existing projects published to Netlify, you can either:

* Keep publishing them to Netlify, or
* Switch to CodinIT hosting

<Warning>
  If your project was published to Netlify before CodinIT hosting was introduced, see the section on **Managing projects published to Netlify before August 14, 2025**.
</Warning>

## Connect CodinIT to your Netlify account

A Netlify account is required to connect CodinIT to Netlify. If you don't have one, [sign up for one](https://app.netlify.com/signup).

Follow these steps to connect your Netlify account to CodinIT:

1. Open any CodinIT project.
2. Click the **gear icon** in the top center of your screen, then click **All project settings**.
3. Click **Applications** under Personal Settings.
4. Click **Connect** in the Netlify section.
5. Log in to Netlify as prompted.
6. Follow Netlify's steps to complete the process.

## Publish new projects to Netlify instead of CodinIT hosting

While CodinIT hosting is the default hosting option provided when you choose to publish a project, you can also choose to connect a Netlify account and publish your project to Netlify hosting instead.

To switch a project from CodinIT to Netlify hosting, two things are required:

* You must not have already published your project to CodinIT hosting. (There is no going back; you'll have to create a new, unpublished copy of the project if you've already published it to CodinIT hosting.)

To switch from CodinIT to Netlify hosting and publish your site, follow these steps:

1. Click the **gear icon** in the top center of your screen, then click **All project settings**.
2. Click **Domains & Hosting**.
3. Use the drop-down to select **Netlify** for your hosting provider.
4. Close the Setting window.
5. Click **Publish** in the top-right corner of your screen.
6. Click the second **Publish** button that appears.
7. Wait about a minute for CodinIT to deploy your site.
8. Click the link that appears in the chat window to open your site (published to Netlify) in your browser.

## Unpublish a project with Netlify hosting

Want to take down a site you've published with Netlify hosting? No problem, just follow these steps:

1. Click the **gear icon** in the top center of your screen, then click **All project settings**.
2. Click **Domains & hosting**.
3. Click the red **Unpublish** text.
4. Confirm by clicking **Unpublish** again.

## Managing projects published to Netlify before August 14, 2025

If you’ve published your site to Netlify prior to August 14, 2025, you have the option of continuing to use Netlify, or you can switch to CodinIT hosting.

How you manage a project published before August 14, 2025 depends on how it was set up:

* **Published by CodinIT to a Netlify domain with no Netlify account connected:** CodinIT created a public copy of your site on a Netlify URL when you originally published it, but you have never connected a Netlify account to CodinIT as an integration.
* **Published by CodinIT to your own connected Netlify account:** CodinIT created a public copy of your site on a Netlify URL connected to your account via the CodinIT/Netlify integration.

The following sections provide information on how to switch to CodinIT hosting, unpublish a project, or add a custom domain.

### Switch a project to CodinIT hosting originally published to Netlify prior to August 14, 2025

Switching a project published to Netlify before August 14, 2025 works the same whether or not you had connected a Netlify account. Follow the steps below:

1. Click the **gear icon** in the top center of your screen, then click **All project settings**.
2. Click **Domains & Hosting**.
3. Click **Switch to CodinIT hosting**.
4. Click **Confirm hosting switch**. CodinIT will begin moving your hosting.
5. Wait about a minute for CodinIT to finish. You’ll see a notification that your site was deployed to a `CodinIT.host` domain.

### Unpublish a project originally published to Netlify prior to August 14, 2025

If you need to remove an older Netlify deployment, how you can do it depends on whether or not you had a Netlify integration connected when the site was published:

* If your project was published to Netlify by CodinIT **without a Netlify integration** set up on your account, [contact CodinIT support](/support/troubleshooting).
* If your site was **connected to your Netlify account** when it was published, you must handle its removal from your Netlify dashboard. To learn more, see Netlify's article on [Deploys, rollback, and deletion](https://www.netlify.com/blog/deploy-deletion/).

### Add a domain to a project originally published to Netlify prior to August 14, 2025

For projects published before August 14, 2025, you can keep working on them and publishing updates to their Netlify URL as usual.

However, you won’t be able to add a custom domain to these projects through the CodinIT chatbox or project settings. To add a custom domain to a CodinIT project published on Netlify prior to August 14, 2025, you’ll need to either:

## Limitations

If you plan to continue using Netlify, you may want to understand more about the platform and the type of software it's designed to host. For example, Netlify can't host your database or a traditional backend.

* [What is Netlify?](https://docs.netlify.com/platform/what-is-netlify): Netlify's own description of their purpose and features.
* [Intro to Composable Architecture](https://www.netlify.com/guide-to-composable-architecture): this is a big topic, but it's worth exploring, as it helps you understand what Netlify can and can't support, and how to build for publishing to Netlify.

<Info>
  Explore Netlify's [website](https://www.netlify.com) and [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com) for full details of Netlify's features.
</Info>

## Publish manually

You can also publish your project to Netlify without connecting your CodinIT account.

1. Run the project build command (usually `npm run build`).
2. Click **Download** to download the project.
3. Follow Netlify's [Manual deploy instructions](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#drag-and-drop).

<Note>
  Note that CodinIT calls this feature **Publish** whereas Netlify calls it **Deploy**.
