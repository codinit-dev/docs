### Getting a Netlify Access Token

1. **Sign Up/Sign In:** Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) and create an account
2. **Navigate to Access Tokens:** Go to User Settings → Applications → Personal access tokens
3. **Create Token:** Click "New access token", give it a name (e.g., "CodinIT")
4. **Copy Token:** Save the token securely

### Configuration in CodinIT

1. **Open Settings:** Click the gear icon on sidebar → Connections tab
2. **Find Netlify:** Scroll to the Netlify connection section
3. **Enter Token:** Paste your access token and click "Connect"
4. **Verify:** You should see your Netlify account information

### Deploying Your Project

1. **Click Deploy:** In any project, click the deploy button in the header
2. **Choose Netlify:** Select "Deploy to Netlify" from the deployment dialog
3. **Wait for Build:** CodinIT automatically builds your project and deploys it
4. **View Live Site:** Click the deployment URL when complete

### Build Configuration

CodinIT automatically detects your build output in these common directories:

- `/dist` - Vite, Rollup
- `/build` - Create React App
- `/out` - Next.js static export
- `/.next` - Next.js (served automatically)
- `/public` - Static sites

### Troubleshooting

**Build Fails:**

- Check the terminal output for build errors
- Ensure your `package.json` has a `build` script
- Verify all dependencies are installed

**Deployment Fails:**

- Confirm your Netlify token has deployment permissions
- Check that your project builds successfully locally
- Ensure build output directory exists and contains files

**Wrong Build Directory:**

- CodinIT tries common directories automatically
- If your build outputs to a different directory, modify your build script
