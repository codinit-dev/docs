### Framework Optimization

Vercel provides automatic optimizations for:

- **Next.js:** ISR, SSR, API routes, middleware
- **React:** Automatic static generation and optimization
- **Static Sites:** Global CDN with instant cache invalidation

### Environment Variables

Set environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

- Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
- Add variables needed for your application
- They will be available during build and runtime

### Troubleshooting

**Build Fails:**

- Check the terminal output for specific errors
- Ensure your build command works locally
- Verify all dependencies are listed in `package.json`

**Deployment Fails:**

- Confirm your Vercel token is valid and has deployment permissions
- Check that your project doesn't exceed Vercel's limits
- Ensure your build produces a valid output directory

**Performance Issues:**

- Vercel automatically optimizes static assets
- Check your bundle size if experiencing slow loads
- Consider using Next.js for better performance
