</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Environment Variables" icon="settings">
    Use different API keys and configurations for development, staging, and production environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Access Controls" icon="shield">
    Configure appropriate permissions for deployment tokens and limit access to necessary resources.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secret Rotation" icon="rotate-ccw">
    Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens for enhanced security.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audit Logs" icon="file-text">
