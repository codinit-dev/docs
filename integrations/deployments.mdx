# Deploy static sites (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
1. Build your application locally
2. Select deployment platform (Netlify/Vercel)
3. Configure build settings and environment variables
4. Deploy with one click or push to trigger auto-deployment
5. Monitor deployment status and access live site
```
</CodeGroup>

### Full-Stack Application Deployment

```bash Full-Stack Workflow
# Deploy applications with backend (Next.js, Nuxt.js, etc.)
1. Configure database connections (Supabase/PostgreSQL)
2. Set up environment variables for API keys
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel/Netlify
4. Deploy backend functions and database schema
5. Configure custom domains and SSL certificates
6. Set up monitoring and error tracking
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build Failures">
    **Problem**: Deployments fail during the build process.

    **Solutions**:
    - Check build logs for specific error messages
    - Verify Node.js version compatibility
    - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
    - Check for syntax errors in your code
    - Verify environment variables are correctly configured
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Environment Variables Not Working">
    **Problem**: Application behaves differently in deployed environment.

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify environment variable names match exactly
    - Check variable values don't contain extra whitespace
    - Ensure variables are set for the correct environment
    - Restart the deployment after variable changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom Domain Issues">
    **Problem**: Custom domain not working or showing SSL errors.

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify DNS records are correctly configured
    - Wait for SSL certificate propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
    - Check domain registrar settings
    - Ensure CNAME records point to correct platform URLs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Connection Errors">
    **Problem**: Application can't connect to database after deployment.

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify database credentials and connection strings
    - Check database is running and accessible
    - Ensure firewall rules allow connections from deployment platform
    - Verify connection pooling configuration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
