title: MCP Integration
description: Connect CodinIT to other services and tools
---

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets CodinIT connect to other services like databases, payment systems, and more. Think of it like adding plugins to make CodinIT more powerful.

## What is MCP?

MCP lets you connect CodinIT to other services you use. For example, you can connect to a database to save user data, or to Stripe to process payments.

## How It Works

### Main Parts

MCP has a few main parts:

  <Card title="Control Panel" icon="sidebar">
    Where you manage all your connections
  </Card>
  <Card title="Marketplace" icon="shopping-bag">
    Ready-made connections you can use

### Types of Connections

MCP can connect in different ways:

- **STDIO**: Local tools on your computer
- **SSE**: Real-time streaming connections
- **HTTP**: Web-based APIs

### Staying Safe

MCP keeps you safe:

- **Approval needed**: You have to approve actions before they run
- **Auto-approve**: You can trust certain actions to run automatically
- **Timeout**: Actions are cancelled if they take too long
- **Check inputs**: Makes sure the data is valid before running

## How to Start

<Steps>

## Managing Connections

### Adding New Services

Add your own custom connections:

- Enter your API keys or tokens
- Set up any special settings
- Test it before saving

### Checking Status

See how your connections are doing:

- Check if they're connected
- See how many tools are available
- Get alerts if something's wrong
- Automatic reconnection if disconnected

### Editing Connections

Manage your existing connections:

- Update login info
- Delete ones you don't use
- Manage multiple at once
- Save and restore settings

## Using Tools

### Finding Tools

Look through available actions:

- See all available tools
- Search by name or type
- See what info each tool needs
- Read instructions for each tool

### Running Tools Safely

Execute tools with safety checks:

- Review before running
- Check that inputs are correct
- Auto-cancel after 30 seconds
- Trust certain tools to run automatically

### Tracking Usage

See what you've done:

- History of all actions
- How long things took
- Errors and problems
- Most-used tools

## Tips for Success

<Callout type="info">
  **Safety First**: Always check what a tool will do before approving it, especially if it changes data.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Start Simple**: Use ready-made connections first, then add custom ones later.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Keep Secrets Safe**: Store API keys securely. MCP keeps everything on your computer and doesn't send it anywhere.
</Callout>

## Fixing Problems

### Can't Connect

Common connection problems:

- **No internet**: Check your internet and firewall
- **Wrong password**: Check your API keys
- **Service down**: Check if the service is working
- **Wrong settings**: Double-check your URLs and settings

### Tools Won't Run

Problems running tools:

- **Timeout**: Tools cancel after 30 seconds
- **Wrong info**: Check required fields
- **No permission**: Make sure your API key has permission
- **Too many requests**: Wait a bit and try again

### Running Slow

Make things faster:

- Reuse connections
- Save frequently-used data
- Do multiple things at once when possible
- Watch for slow spots

## Examples

### Database Example

```typescript
// Get user data from Supabase
const users = await mcp.executeTool('supabase', 'query_users', {
  table: 'users',
  filter: { status: 'active' }
});
```

### Payment Example

```typescript
// Process a payment with Stripe
const payment = await mcp.executeTool('stripe', 'create_payment_intent', {
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'usd',
  customer_id: 'cus_123'
});
```

### AI Example

```typescript
// Generate code with AI
const code = await mcp.executeTool('claude-code', 'generate_component', {
  component_type: 'React',
  description: 'User profile form'
});
```
