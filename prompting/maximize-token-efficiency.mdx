title: 'Maximize Token Efficiency'
description: How to use AI without spending too much
---

Learn how to use AI smartly so you don't run out of credits or money. Think of tokens like text messages - the more you send, the more it costs.

## What Are Tokens?

CodinIT uses AI that runs on "tokens." Tokens are small pieces of text that the AI reads and writes.

### How Tokens Get Used

Tokens are used when:

- **You ask questions**: Your messages to the AI
- **AI answers**: The code and explanations the AI gives you
- **Context**: The AI reading your project files to understand what you're building

### What Affects Token Usage

- **Which AI model**: Some models cost more than others
- **Project size**: Bigger projects use more tokens
- **Answer length**: Long explanations use more tokens than short ones
- **Chat length**: Longer conversations use more tokens

<Callout type="info">
  **Token Limits**: Each AI has a maximum amount of text it can handle at once. If you go over, you might get errors.
</Callout>

## How to Save Tokens

### Use Buttons Instead of Typing

CodinIT has buttons and menus that don't use tokens:

- **Example prompts**: Click suggested prompts instead of typing
- **File operations**: Use the file tree to create/delete files
- **Terminal**: Run commands yourself instead of asking AI

### Write Better Requests

**Be specific and short:**

```
❌ "Make this website look better"
✅ "Add a hero section with gradient background, centered heading, and button"
```

**Give helpful details:**

```
❌ "Fix the login page" (AI has to search everything)
✅ "Fix the password error on /login - it breaks when password is less than 8 characters"
```

**Use numbered lists:**

```
❌ "Add user authentication"
✅ "Add user authentication with: 1) Login form, 2) Registration form, 3) Password reset, 4) Protected routes"
```

## Key Efficiency Techniques

### Use Discussion Mode for Planning

Switch to discussion mode when you need guidance without code implementation:

- **Planning Phase**: Use discussion mode to plan features before implementing
- **Architecture Decisions**: Get advice on system design and technology choices
- **Code Review**: Discuss code improvements without making changes
- **Learning**: Ask questions and get explanations without consuming implementation tokens

### Strategic Development Approach

**Plan Before You Build:**

- Outline your application structure and features upfront
- Break complex projects into manageable phases
- Identify potential challenges before implementation
- Create a development roadmap to guide your work

**Iterative Development:**

- Implement features incrementally rather than all at once
- Test and validate each component before moving to the next
- Use version control to track progress and enable rollbacks
- Focus on core functionality before adding advanced features

### Error Handling Strategies

**Avoid Repeated Fix Attempts:**

- Don't repeatedly click "Attempt fix" for the same error
- Analyze error messages to understand root causes
- Use discussion mode to get guidance on complex issues
- Implement proper error handling in your code to prevent future issues

**Add Comprehensive Error Handling:**

- Include detailed logging to understand error patterns
- Implement graceful error states in your UI
- Add input validation to prevent common errors
- Use try-catch blocks appropriately in your code

### Project Size Management

**Optimize Project Structure:**

- Keep files under 500 lines when possible
- Split large components into smaller, focused modules
- Remove unused dependencies and code
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms

**Context Window Management:**

- Be mindful of how much context your project provides
- Use specific file references instead of broad requests
- Clean up chat history when conversations become too long
- Focus on specific components rather than entire applications

<Callout type="info">
  **Discussion Mode**: Use discussion mode for planning, architecture decisions, and getting guidance without
  implementing code changes.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Version Control**: Leverage Git/version control features to manage project state without consuming AI tokens for
  undo operations.

## Model Selection Strategies

### Choose Appropriate Models

Different AI models have different strengths and token costs:

- **Use smaller models** for simple tasks, drafting, and initial development
- **Reserve larger models** for complex reasoning, code review, and final polishing
- **Consider model context limits** when working with large codebases
- **Balance cost vs. capability** based on your current development phase

### Provider-Specific Optimization

**Anthropic Claude:**

- Excellent for reasoning and code generation
- Higher token costs but superior code quality
- Best for complex development tasks

**OpenAI GPT:**

- Fast and cost-effective for many tasks
- Good for quick iterations and prototyping
- Consider GPT-4 for complex reasoning tasks

**Other Providers:**

- Evaluate based on specific use cases
- Consider regional availability and data privacy requirements
- Compare pricing and performance for your workload

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Context Management

**File-Specific Requests:**

- Reference specific files instead of asking about "the entire codebase"
- Use imports and dependencies to provide necessary context
- Focus on individual components rather than full applications

**Progressive Development:**

- Build core functionality first, then add features incrementally
- Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
- Use modular architecture to keep context windows manageable

### Performance Monitoring

**Track Your Usage:**

- Monitor token consumption across different tasks
- Identify patterns in high-token activities
- Adjust your approach based on usage analytics

**Optimize Workflows:**

- Combine related changes into single requests
- Use batch operations when possible
- Plan complex changes to minimize back-and-forth communication

<Callout type="info">
  **Token Awareness**: Understanding token consumption helps you work more efficiently and control costs. Focus on
  quality over quantity in your interactions.

<Callout type="tip">
  **Continuous Learning**: As you work more with AI models, you'll develop intuition for which approaches are most
  token-efficient for different types of tasks.
