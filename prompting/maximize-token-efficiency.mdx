description: How to use AI without spending too much

Learn how to use AI smartly so you don't run out of credits or money. Think of tokens like text messages - the more you send, the more it costs.

## What Are Tokens?

CodinIT uses AI that runs on "tokens." Tokens are small pieces of text that the AI reads and writes.

### How Tokens Get Used

Tokens are used when:

- **You ask questions**: Your messages to the AI
- **AI answers**: The code and explanations the AI gives you
- **Context**: The AI reading your project files to understand what you're building

### What Affects Token Usage

- **Which AI model**: Some models cost more than others
- **Project size**: Bigger projects use more tokens
- **Answer length**: Long explanations use more tokens than short ones
- **Chat length**: Longer conversations use more tokens

<Callout type="info">
  **Token Limits**: Each AI has a maximum amount of text it can handle at once. If you go over, you might get errors.
</Callout>

## How to Save Tokens

### Use Buttons Instead of Typing

CodinIT has buttons and menus that don't use tokens:

- **Example prompts**: Click suggested prompts instead of typing
- **File operations**: Use the file tree to create/delete files
- **Terminal**: Run commands yourself instead of asking AI

### Write Better Requests

**Be specific and short:**

```
❌ "Make this website look better"
✅ "Add a hero section with gradient background, centered heading, and button"
```

**Give helpful details:**

```
❌ "Fix the login page" (AI has to search everything)
✅ "Fix the password error on /login - it breaks when password is less than 8 characters"
```

**Use numbered lists:**

```
❌ "Add user authentication"
✅ "Add user authentication with: 1) Login form, 2) Registration form, 3) Password reset, 4) Protected routes"
```

## Smart Ways to Save Tokens

### Use Discussion Mode for Planning

When you just want to talk and plan (not write code), use discussion mode:

- **Planning**: Talk about features before building them
- **Getting advice**: Ask which tools to use
- **Code review**: Discuss improvements without changing code
- **Learning**: Ask questions without generating code

### Plan Before You Build

**Think first:**

- Write down what your app should do
- Break big projects into small pieces
- Think about problems you might face
- Make a plan for what to build first

**Build step by step:**

- Add one feature at a time
- Test each piece before moving on
- Use Git to save your progress
- Build the main features first, fancy stuff later

### Don't Waste Tokens on Errors

**When something breaks:**

- Don't keep clicking "fix" over and over
- Read the error message to understand what's wrong
- Use discussion mode to ask for help
- Add error handling so it doesn't break again

**Prevent errors:**

- Add logging to see what's happening
- Show friendly error messages to users
- Check user input before using it
- Use try-catch to handle errors gracefully

### Keep Your Project Small

**Organize your files:**

- Keep files under 500 lines
- Split big files into smaller ones
- Delete code you're not using
- Use simple, efficient code

**Manage context:**

- Don't include your whole project in every request
- Reference specific files instead
- Start a new chat when conversations get too long
- Focus on one part of your app at a time

  **Discussion Mode**: Use this when you want to talk and plan without writing code. It saves tokens!

<Callout type="tip">
  **Use Git**: Save your work with Git instead of asking AI to undo things. It's free!

## Model Selection Strategies

### Choose Appropriate Models

Different AI models have different strengths and token costs:

- **Use smaller models** for simple tasks, drafting, and initial development
- **Reserve larger models** for complex reasoning, code review, and final polishing
- **Consider model context limits** when working with large codebases
- **Balance cost vs. capability** based on your current development phase

### Provider-Specific Optimization

**Anthropic Claude:**

- Excellent for reasoning and code generation
- Higher token costs but superior code quality
- Best for complex development tasks

**OpenAI GPT:**

- Fast and cost-effective for many tasks
- Good for quick iterations and prototyping
- Consider GPT-4 for complex reasoning tasks

**Other Providers:**

- Evaluate based on specific use cases
- Consider regional availability and data privacy requirements
- Compare pricing and performance for your workload

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Context Management

**File-Specific Requests:**

- Reference specific files instead of asking about "the entire codebase"
- Use imports and dependencies to provide necessary context
- Focus on individual components rather than full applications

**Progressive Development:**

- Build core functionality first, then add features incrementally
- Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
- Use modular architecture to keep context windows manageable

### Performance Monitoring

**Track Your Usage:**

- Monitor token consumption across different tasks
- Identify patterns in high-token activities
- Adjust your approach based on usage analytics

**Optimize Workflows:**

- Combine related changes into single requests
- Use batch operations when possible
- Plan complex changes to minimize back-and-forth communication

  **Token Awareness**: Understanding token consumption helps you work more efficiently and control costs. Focus on
  quality over quantity in your interactions.

  **Continuous Learning**: As you work more with AI models, you'll develop intuition for which approaches are most
  token-efficient for different types of tasks.
