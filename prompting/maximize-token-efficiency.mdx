> Optimize token usage to keep your costs down

## Understand tokens

CodinIT runs on AI agents powered by large language model (LLM) providers such as Anthropic. Each agent has a specific role and they work together to plan, generate, and improve your application.

To make this work, CodinIT uses **tokens** from the provider. A token is a small chunk of text, sometimes a full word and sometimes just part of one.

Every time you use CodinIT, tokens are used in three main ways:

* When you chat with CodinIT
* When CodinIT writes code
* When CodinIT looks at your code to see what you changed

## Use buttons instead of prompting where possible

Most prompts use tokens, so avoid them when CodinIT already provides buttons or built-in actions for the same task, which don't use tokens. For example:

* To publish the latest version of your site, use the Publish button instead of prompting CodinIT.
* To revert to a previous version of your project, use the Version History feature instead of prompting CodinIT.

## How you can reduce token usage

Every chatbox interaction you have with CodinIT costs tokens, which affect your speed, cost, and project size limits.

CodinIT is built to keep token usage lean, and ongoing improvements continue to boost efficiency. At the same time, being mindful of how you use tokens is important for keeping projects smooth and cost-effective.

This page lists the top ways to reduce token usage, including the following tips:

* Plan your app
* Use Discussion mode
* Undo changes using the Version history feature
* Keep your prompts specific and focused
* Avoid repeated automated error fix attempts
* Add functionality incrementally
* Use the `.CodinIT/ignore` file
* Reduce the size of your project

## Plan your app

Planning your app before you start building saves time, tokens, and avoids headaches later. Start by deciding what type of app you’re making (website, web app, or mobile app) and who it’s for.

List the key features you want, sketch out a simple design, and think about how users will move through the app.

Examples:

* A **CRM** might need lead capture, contact profiles, and search filters
* A **portfolio site** needs galleries, project descriptions, and contact links
* A **habit tracker** might include a daily checklist, progress charts, and reminders

Once you have a plan, you can write a clear first prompt and build your app step by step. This makes it easier to test changes, catch issues early, and maintain stability as your project grows.

### Use Plan or Discussion Modes

In Build mode, CodinIT updates your code everytime you submit a prompt, which uses up tokens.

To avoid unnecessary code changes, use Plan or Discussion mode when you want to get help, troubleshoot, or discuss plans, but don't want to implement anything immediately.

Both Plan and Discussion Modes uses far fewer tokens than Build Mode.

## Undo changes using the Version history feature

Use the [Version history](/features/overview) feature to restore your project to a previous state without consuming tokens. This is similar to an undo button that can take you back to any prior state of your project.

If you've made a change you don't like, rather than prompting CodinIT to fix it, you can switch back to a previous version of your project without using tokens.

This can save time and tokens if something goes wrong with your project.

## Keep your prompts specific and focused

When prompting, be clear and specific. See [Prompt effectively](/prompting/prompting-effectively) for more information. Tell the model to focus on specific files or functions rather than the entire codebase.

## Avoid repeated automated error fix attempts

When an error occurs, CodinIT gives you the option to try an automatic fix. Sometimes clicking it a second time will resolve the issue, but remember that each attempt uses tokens. Avoid clicking **Attempt fix** over and over, hoping for things to eventually work out.

If CodinIT can’t resolve the issue with automatic fixes, research the errors you’re getting and step in manually.

You can also switch to Discussion mode to ask focused questions, explore solutions, and confirm a plan before the next fix.

## Add error handling to your project

If you find yourself stuck in an error loop, a useful strategy is to prompt CodinIT to enhance error handling and implement detailed logging throughout the problematic area.

When prompted to, CodinIT excels at inserting robust error logs, even at a granular level, such as between functions or key steps. These logs provide valuable feedback that the AI can use to better understand the root cause of the issue.

This additional logging also provides more precise information when the error occurs again. With this detailed feedback, CodinIT can make more accurate adjustments to fix the issue.

## Add functionality incrementally

Before you focus on advanced functionality, make sure the basics of your app are in place.

* **Create your core pages:** For example, a homepage, a dashboard, and a basic contact or help page
* **Set up navigation:** Make sure users can move between pages smoothly, like jumping from a leads page to a customer profile in a CRM
* **Keep the design consistent:** Use the same colors, fonts, and layout so the app feels professional and easy to use

Once you have that solid foundation, add new features one at a time.

* Start small, such as adding a form to capture leads or customer data
* Next, add functionality to store and display those records, like a simple customer list or profile view
* Then layer on search, filters, or analytics so users can find data quickly
* Test after each new piece to catch problems early and avoid breaking what already works

This step-by-step approach makes it easier to test changes, fix issues as they arise, and maintain your app's stability as it grows. Think of it like building with blocks: get the base right, then stack on new pieces carefully so everything stays strong.

## Use a `.CodinIT/ignore` file

In the `.CodinIT/ignore` file, you can list any files or folders that you want CodinIT to exclude.

<Warning>
  Instructing CodinIT to ignore files can have unintended consequences, as CodinIT is no longer aware of your entire project. This approach is powerful, but is only recommended for advanced users who can make informed decisions about what can safely be excluded, and can understand and resolve issues that may arise from this approach.
</Warning>

To add files or folders to the list, follow the steps below:

1. In your CodinIT project, switch to **Code** view to view your file list.
2. Log in to your [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) account.
3. Either:
   * In the `.CodinIT` directory, click `ignore` to open the file in the editor.
   * If there isn't an `ignore` file, right-click the `.CodinIT` directory, then click **New File...**, then name the file `ignore`.
4. List the files you want CodinIT to ignore. Provide the full path to the files, including directories. You can use as a wildcard. For example: to ignore all files in a directory called `test`, write `test/*` in your `ignore` file. These files are now completely invisible to the AI, which frees up space in the context window.

## Reduce the size of your project

As your project grows, more tokens are required to keep CodinIT in sync with your code.

Larger projects (and longer chat conversations) demand more resources for the AI to stay aware of the context, so it's important to be mindful of how project size impacts token usage.

### Clean up unused files

CodinIT uses a tool called Knip to perform a cleanup. You can run this when prompted by CodinIT, or run it manually at any time.

Before proceeding, back up your project using one or both of these methods:

* In the top left of your screen, click the **project title**, then click **Export** > **Download**, **or**
* In the top left of your screen, click the **project title**, then click **Duplicate**.

**Automatic cleanup when prompted**

If your CodinIT project exceeds the context window, you’ll see a message in chat: **Project size exceeded**. The context window is the maximum amount of information CodinIT can process at once. Paid plans offer larger windows, allowing bigger projects before reaching this limit.

Click **Remove unused files** to run the cleanup.

**Manually run the cleanup**

In the CodinIT terminal run the following command:

`npx knip --production --fix --allow-remove-files`

Check the output in the terminal to see if the command ran successfully. This command removes unnecessary files from the codebase, which reduces the project size.

### Split the project

An advanced technique is to split a large app into smaller parts, then connect them later outside of CodinIT. A common approach is to keep the backend and frontend as separate projects. If you are new to development, proceed carefully or get help.

If you decide to try this, keep in mind:

* Plan what each part is responsible for.
* Decide how the parts will talk to each other, such as through an API.
* Keep each project in its own repository or folder.
* Write down how to set up and run each part.

### Split files longer than 500 lines

It's usually best to keep files less than around 500 lines. If you find that one of your files has grown larger than that, try the following prompt:

`Refactor [filename] by splitting it into multiple files. Add comments to understand what each new file is for. Keep the original file to act as a router for functions, so the app remains functional after the split.`

### Reset your chat history window

Resetting your chat history reduces the information sent to CodinIT. Before you do this, ask CodinIT to summarize your chat history so you can keep track of important details.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. In the bottom-left corner of the chatbox, click the **plus icon**, then click  **Discussion mode**.
2. Enter this prompt: `Please generate a short summary of our conversation so far`.
3. Check that CodinIT’s response is accurate and contains everything you need.
4. Copy the response out of CodinIT and save it as a `.txt` or `.md` file.

Next, reset your chat history:

1. In the top left of your screen, click the **project title**, then click **Duplicate**.
2. If you have integrations active in the project, CodinIT displays a dialog that confirms which integration settings it will copy. Click **Duplicate** in the dialog to continue.
3. CodinIT creates a new copy of the project, with an empty chat history.

Lastly, in your new project, add the chat summary:

1. In the bottom-left corner of the chatbox, click the **plus icon**, then click  **Discussion mode**.
2. Click the **plus icon** again, then click **Attach a file**. 
3. Attach the `.txt` or `.md` file you saved earlier.
4. Enter this prompt: `The attached file is a summary of the previous discussion about this project. Use it when working on future changes.`
5. Press `Enter` to upload the file and your prompt.
