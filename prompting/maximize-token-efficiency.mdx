Learn how to use AI smartly so you don't run out of credits or money. Think of tokens like text messages - the more you send, the more it costs.

## What Are Tokens?

CodinIT uses AI that runs on "tokens." Tokens are small pieces of text that the AI reads and writes.

### How Tokens Get Used

Tokens are used when:

- **You ask questions**: Your messages to the AI
- **AI answers**: The code and explanations the AI gives you
- **Context**: The AI reading your project files to understand what you're building

### What Affects Token Usage

- **Which AI model**: Some models cost more than others
- **Project size**: Bigger projects use more tokens
- **Answer length**: Long explanations use more tokens than short ones
- **Chat length**: Longer conversations use more tokens

<Callout type="info">
  **Token Limits**: Each AI has a maximum amount of text it can handle at once. If you go over, you might get errors.
</Callout>

## How to Save Tokens

### Use Buttons Instead of Typing

CodinIT has buttons and menus that don't use tokens:

- **Example prompts**: Click suggested prompts instead of typing
- **File operations**: Use the file tree to create/delete files
- **Terminal**: Run commands yourself instead of asking AI

### Write Better Requests

**Be specific and short:**

```
❌ "Make this website look better"
✅ "Add a hero section with gradient background, centered heading, and button"
```

**Give helpful details:**

```
❌ "Fix the login page" (AI has to search everything)
✅ "Fix the password error on /login - it breaks when password is less than 8 characters"
```

**Use numbered lists:**

```
❌ "Add user authentication"
✅ "Add user authentication with: 1) Login form, 2) Registration form, 3) Password reset, 4) Protected routes"
```

## Smart Ways to Save Tokens

### Use Discussion Mode for Planning

When you just want to talk and plan (not write code), use discussion mode:

- **Planning**: Talk about features before building them
- **Getting advice**: Ask which tools to use
- **Code review**: Discuss improvements without changing code
- **Learning**: Ask questions without generating code

### Plan Before You Build

**Think first:**

- Write down what your app should do
- Break big projects into small pieces
- Think about problems you might face
- Make a plan for what to build first

**Build step by step:**

- Add one feature at a time
- Test each piece before moving on
- Use Git to save your progress
- Build the main features first, fancy stuff later

### Don't Waste Tokens on Errors

**When something breaks:**

- Don't keep clicking "fix" over and over
- Read the error message to understand what's wrong
- Use discussion mode to ask for help
- Add error handling so it doesn't break again

**Prevent errors:**

- Add logging to see what's happening
- Show friendly error messages to users
- Check user input before using it
- Use try-catch to handle errors gracefully

### Keep Your Project Small

**Organize your files:**

- Keep files under 500 lines
- Split big files into smaller ones
- Delete code you're not using
- Use simple, efficient code

**Manage context:**

- Don't include your whole project in every request
- Reference specific files instead
- Start a new chat when conversations get too long
- Focus on one part of your app at a time

  **Discussion Mode**: Use this when you want to talk and plan without writing code. It saves tokens!

<Callout type="tip">
  **Use Git**: Save your work with Git instead of asking AI to undo things. It's free!

## Choosing the Right AI Model

### Pick the Right Model for the Job

Different AI models cost different amounts:

- **Cheaper models** for simple tasks and quick questions
- **Expensive models** for hard problems and important code
- **Check limits** - some models can't handle huge projects
- **Balance cost and quality** based on what you're doing

### Different AI Models

**Claude (Anthropic):**

- Great at understanding and writing code
- Costs more but gives better results
- Use for complex projects

**GPT (OpenAI):**

- Fast and cheaper for many tasks
- Good for trying things out quickly
- Use GPT-4 for harder problems

**Other Models:**

- Check what they're good at
- Some work better in certain countries
- Compare prices for what you need

## Advanced Tips

### Focus Your Requests

**Be specific about files:**

- Name the exact files you're working on
- Don't ask about "the whole project"
- Focus on one part at a time

**Build gradually:**

- Start with the main features
- Test each piece before adding more
- Keep your code organized in small pieces

### Watch Your Usage

**Track what you use:**

- See which tasks use the most tokens
- Notice patterns in what costs more
- Change your approach based on what you learn

**Work smarter:**

- Combine related requests into one
- Do multiple things at once when possible
- Plan ahead to avoid going back and forth
