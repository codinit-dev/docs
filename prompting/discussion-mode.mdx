title: Discussion Mode
description: Technical consultant mode for collaborative problem-solving and guidance
---

Discussion mode transforms the AI into a technical consultant who provides guidance, plans, and structured approaches to development challenges without directly implementing code. When activated, CodinIT switches to a specialized system prompt designed specifically for consultative interactions.

## Overview

In discussion mode, the AI acts as an experienced senior software engineer and technical consultant, offering strategic advice, architectural guidance, and detailed planning for your development projects. Unlike build mode, discussion mode focuses on planning and guidance rather than code generation.

## Key Features

- **Technical Consulting**: Expert guidance on development approaches and best practices
- **Strategic Planning**: Structured plans for implementing features and solving problems
- **Code Review Guidance**: Advice on code quality, architecture, and optimization
- **Technology Recommendations**: Suggestions for tools, frameworks, and libraries
- **Debugging Strategies**: Systematic approaches to identifying and resolving issues

## How It Works

When you activate discussion mode, CodinIT switches to a specialized system prompt (`discussPrompt`) that fundamentally changes how the AI responds:

- **Planning Over Implementation**: Provides detailed numbered plans with file references and plain English descriptions instead of code
- **Educational Approach**: Explains concepts, reasoning, and best practices with "why" behind recommendations
- **Strategic Thinking**: Uses chain-of-thought reasoning to analyze problems before providing solutions
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Offers quick action buttons for implementing plans, continuing discussions, or opening referenced files
- **No Code Generation**: Responses describe changes in plain English rather than providing code snippets

The system prompt explicitly instructs the AI to use phrases like "You should add..." instead of "I will implement..." to maintain the consultative role.

## Discussion Mode Interface

### Activating Discussion Mode

Click the "Discuss" button in the chat interface to switch to technical consultant mode. The AI will confirm the mode change and be ready to provide consultative guidance.

### Response Format

In discussion mode, responses follow a specific structure:

- **Chain of Thought**: Visible reasoning process showing how the AI analyzes the problem
- **Clear Plans**: Numbered steps starting with "## The Plan" heading, describing changes in plain English only
- **File References**: Specific file paths with corresponding quick action buttons to open them
- **Technology Recommendations**: Specific tools and approaches with reasoning
- **Best Practice Guidance**: Industry-standard approaches with explanations
- **Quick Actions**: Interactive buttons at the end of every response:
  - **Implement**: For executing the outlined plan in build mode
  - **Message**: For continuing the conversation with specific follow-ups
  - **Link**: For opening external documentation or resources
  - **File**: For opening referenced files in the editor

The AI is explicitly instructed to never include code snippets in plans, only plain English descriptions of what needs to change.

## Best Practices for Discussion Mode

### Preparing Your Questions

**Be Specific About Your Goals:**

```
❌ "Help me build an app"
✅ "I need to build a task management app for a team of 10 developers. What architecture would you recommend for real-time collaboration features?"
```

**Provide Context:**

```
❌ "My code is slow"
✅ "I'm building a React dashboard that loads 1000+ data points. Currently using useEffect with fetch. What optimization strategies would you suggest?"
```

### Effective Question Types

**Architecture Questions:**

- "What's the best way to structure a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform?"
- "How should I handle state management in a large-scale React application?"

**Technology Selection:**

- "Should I use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for a social media analytics platform?"
- "What's the recommended approach for implementing real-time features in a web application?"

**Code Quality & Patterns:**

- "How can I improve the performance of this database query?"
- "What design patterns would be appropriate for implementing a plugin system?"

### Maximizing Value from Discussions

**Iterative Refinement:**
Start with high-level questions, then drill down into specifics based on the guidance provided.

**Actionable Plans:**
Look for responses that include specific, implementable steps rather than vague suggestions.

**Follow-up Questions:**
Use the AI's recommendations as a foundation for more detailed questions about implementation.

## Response Characteristics

### Planning-Focused Responses

Discussion mode responses emphasize planning and strategy:

- **Step-by-step implementation plans** with "## The Plan" heading
- **Technology recommendations with reasoning** explaining why specific tools are suggested
- **Consideration of trade-offs and alternatives** for different approaches
- **Scalability and maintainability considerations** for long-term success
- **File-specific guidance** indicating exactly which files need modification

### Educational Approach

Responses include educational elements:

- **Chain of thought reasoning** visible to users before solutions
- **Explanation of concepts and principles** with context
- **Rationale behind recommendations** explaining the "why"
- **Industry best practices and standards** with current information
- **Common pitfalls and how to avoid them** based on experience

### Interactive Elements

Discussion mode always includes interactive quick action buttons:

- **Implement buttons** to execute plans in build mode (labeled "Implement this plan", "Fix this bug", "Fix these issues", or database-specific actions)
- **Message buttons** for continuing conversations with specific prompts
- **Link buttons** for opening external documentation (especially for topics in support resources)
- **File buttons** for opening referenced files in the editor
- **Ordered by priority**: Implement actions first, then message, link, and file actions
- **Limited to 4-5 actions** to avoid overwhelming users
