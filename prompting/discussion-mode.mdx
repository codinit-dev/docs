title: Discussion Mode
description: Technical consultant mode for collaborative problem-solving and guidance
---

Discussion mode transforms the AI into a technical consultant who provides guidance, plans, and structured approaches to development challenges without directly implementing code. When activated, CodinIT switches to a specialized system prompt designed specifically for consultative interactions.

## Overview

In discussion mode, the AI acts as an experienced senior software engineer and technical consultant, offering strategic advice, architectural guidance, and detailed planning for your development projects. Unlike build mode, discussion mode focuses on planning and guidance rather than code generation.

## Key Features

- **Technical Consulting**: Expert guidance on development approaches and best practices
- **Strategic Planning**: Structured plans for implementing features and solving problems
- **Code Review Guidance**: Advice on code quality, architecture, and optimization
- **Technology Recommendations**: Suggestions for tools, frameworks, and libraries
- **Debugging Strategies**: Systematic approaches to identifying and resolving issues

## How It Works

When you activate discussion mode, CodinIT switches to a specialized system prompt (`discussPrompt`) that fundamentally changes how the AI responds:

- **Planning Over Implementation**: Provides detailed numbered plans with file references and plain English descriptions instead of code
- **Educational Approach**: Explains concepts, reasoning, and best practices with "why" behind recommendations
- **Strategic Thinking**: Uses chain-of-thought reasoning to analyze problems before providing solutions
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Offers quick action buttons for implementing plans, continuing discussions, or opening referenced files
- **No Code Generation**: Responses describe changes in plain English rather than providing code snippets

The system prompt explicitly instructs the AI to use phrases like "You should add..." instead of "I will implement..." to maintain the consultative role.

## When to Use Discussion Mode

### Architecture & Planning

- Designing system architecture for new applications
- Planning database schemas and data models
- Choosing between different technical approaches
- Evaluating framework and library options

### Code Quality & Best Practices

- Reviewing existing code for improvements
- Learning modern development patterns
- Understanding design principles and their application
- Getting guidance on code organization and structure

### Problem-Solving & Debugging

- Analyzing complex bugs or performance issues
- Developing systematic debugging strategies
- Understanding error patterns and root causes
- Planning refactoring and optimization efforts

### Learning & Skill Development

- Understanding advanced programming concepts
- Learning new technologies and frameworks
- Exploring industry best practices
- Developing problem-solving methodologies

## Discussion Mode Interface

### Activating Discussion Mode

Click the "Discuss" button in the chat interface to switch to technical consultant mode. The AI will confirm the mode change and be ready to provide consultative guidance.

### Response Format

In discussion mode, responses typically include:

- **Clear Plans**: Numbered steps for implementing solutions
- **Technology Recommendations**: Specific tools and approaches
- **Best Practice Guidance**: Industry-standard approaches
- **Educational Context**: Explanations of why certain approaches are recommended
- **Quick Actions**: Interactive buttons for common next steps

## Best Practices for Discussion Mode

### Preparing Your Questions

**Be Specific About Your Goals:**

```
❌ "Help me build an app"
✅ "I need to build a task management app for a team of 10 developers. What architecture would you recommend for real-time collaboration features?"
```

**Provide Context:**

```
❌ "My code is slow"
✅ "I'm building a React dashboard that loads 1000+ data points. Currently using useEffect with fetch. What optimization strategies would you suggest?"
```

### Effective Question Types

**Architecture Questions:**

- "What's the best way to structure a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform?"
- "How should I handle state management in a large-scale React application?"

**Technology Selection:**

- "Should I use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for a social media analytics platform?"
- "What's the recommended approach for implementing real-time features in a web application?"

**Code Quality & Patterns:**

- "How can I improve the performance of this database query?"
- "What design patterns would be appropriate for implementing a plugin system?"

### Maximizing Value from Discussions

**Iterative Refinement:**
Start with high-level questions, then drill down into specifics based on the guidance provided.

**Actionable Plans:**
Look for responses that include specific, implementable steps rather than vague suggestions.

**Follow-up Questions:**
Use the AI's recommendations as a foundation for more detailed questions about implementation.

## Response Characteristics

### Planning-Focused Responses

Discussion mode responses emphasize planning and strategy:

- **Step-by-step implementation plans**
- **Technology recommendations with reasoning**
- **Consideration of trade-offs and alternatives**
- **Scalability and maintainability considerations**

### Educational Approach

Responses include educational elements:

- **Explanation of concepts and principles**
- **Rationale behind recommendations**
- **Industry best practices and standards**
- **Common pitfalls and how to avoid them**

### Interactive Elements

Discussion mode often includes interactive elements:

- **Quick action buttons** for common next steps
- **File references** for examining specific code
- **Link suggestions** for additional resources
- **Structured recommendations** with clear priorities\*\*

## Integration with Other Features

### Combining with Regular Chat

You can switch between discussion mode and regular chat mode:

1. Use **discussion mode** for planning and architectural decisions
2. Switch to **regular chat** for implementation and code writing
3. Return to **discussion mode** for reviewing and refining implemented code

### Using with Project Context

Discussion mode works best when you provide:

- **Current project structure** and technology stack
- **Existing code snippets** for review
- **Performance requirements** and constraints
- **Team size and expertise** levels
- **Timeline and resource** considerations

## Common Use Cases

### Startup Development

```
Planning MVP architecture, choosing tech stack, designing scalable systems
```

### Enterprise Applications

```
Large-scale system design, performance optimization, security considerations
```

### Learning Projects

```
Understanding advanced concepts, exploring new technologies, building best practices
```

### Code Reviews

```
Analyzing existing codebases, identifying improvement opportunities, planning refactoring
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Context**: Provide background about your project, team, and goals
2. **Ask Specific Questions**: Clear, focused questions get better guidance
3. **Iterate on Plans**: Use initial plans as starting points for more detailed discussions
4. **Combine Modes**: Use discussion mode for planning, regular mode for implementation
5. **Follow Recommendations**: The structured plans are designed to be actionable

<Callout type="info">
  **Discussion Mode Philosophy**: The goal is to empower you with knowledge and planning skills, not to do the work for
  you. This approach helps you grow as a developer while building better software.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **When to Switch Modes**: Use discussion mode when you need guidance, planning, or learning. Switch to regular chat
  mode when you're ready to implement the plans and write code.
