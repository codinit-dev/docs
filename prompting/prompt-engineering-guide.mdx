Learn how to ask the AI for what you want in a way that gets you the best results. Think of it like giving clear instructions to a helpful assistant.

## How AI Understands You

Different AI models are good at different things. The key is to be clear about what you want, just like explaining something to a friend.

## Tell the AI What Tools to Use

### Be Specific About Your Tools

The AI works better when you tell it exactly what tools and technologies you want to use. It's like telling a chef what ingredients to cook with.

**Good example:**

```
Build an online store dashboard with:
- React for the website
- Supabase for saving data
- Tailwind CSS to make it look nice
- React Router to move between pages
```

### Popular Tool Combinations

| What You're Building | Good Tools to Use | What It's For |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Website** | React + TypeScript | Making interactive websites |
| **Styling**            | Tailwind CSS       | Making things look pretty |
| **Saving Data**            | Supabase           | Storing user information      |
| **Managing Data**   | Zustand            | Keeping track of app information    |

### Tips for Different Frameworks

**If you're using React:**
- Say if you want modern or old-style components
- Mention how you want to handle data
- Tell it how pages should connect

**If you're using Vue:**
- Specify which Vue style you prefer
- Mention any UI libraries you like
- Say what build tool you're using

**For the Backend:**
- Say if you want REST or GraphQL APIs
- Mention if you need user login
- Tell it how to check if data is correct

## Advanced AI prompting techniques for code generation

### Contextual information for better LLM results

**Provide relevant context for AI code generation:**

- Include existing code snippets when relevant for AI understanding
- Reference specific files or components for LLM context
- Mention current technology constraints for AI-powered development
- Specify performance requirements for optimized code generation

**Progressive refinement with AI prompting:**

- Start with high-level requirements for AI planning
- Add implementation details iteratively for better LLM results
- Use follow-up prompts for AI clarification
- Build upon previous AI responses for iterative development

### LLM-specific optimization for AI coding

**Claude/Gemini AI models:**

- Provide comprehensive context upfront for better AI code generation
- Use structured formats (numbered lists, sections) for LLM understanding
- Include examples and edge cases for robust AI development
- Specify output format preferences for consistent code generation

**GPT AI models:**

- Break complex requests into smaller parts for better LLM processing
- Use clear, direct language for optimal AI code generation
- Provide concrete examples for accurate LLM understanding
- Specify desired output structure for consistent AI results

### Error Prevention

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- Vague requirements that lead to assumptions
- Missing technical specifications
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Unspecified integration requirements

**Validation Techniques:**

- Include acceptance criteria
- Specify testing requirements
- Define success metrics
- Request validation checkpoints

## AI prompt engineering best practices summary

### Essential AI prompting principles for code generation

1. **Clarity first**: Be specific about what you want to build with AI code generation and how it should work
2. **Technology specification**: Clearly state your preferred frameworks and libraries for LLM understanding
3. **Context provision**: Include relevant background information and constraints for better AI results
4. **Iterative AI approach**: Start simple, then add complexity through follow-up prompts for optimal code generation

### AI code generation quality checklist

**Before submitting AI prompts:**

- ✅ Goal is clearly defined for LLM understanding
- ✅ Technology stack is specified for AI code generation
- ✅ Key features are listed for comprehensive AI development
- ✅ User requirements are outlined for accurate LLM results
- ✅ Success criteria are defined for measurable AI outcomes

**During AI-powered development:**

- 🔄 Provide feedback on AI-generated code for improvement
- 🔄 Request specific modifications from LLM for refinement
- 🔄 Ask for AI explanations when needed for understanding
- 🔄 Use AI discussion mode for architecture planning

### Common Success Patterns

**Effective Prompts Include:**

- Specific functionality requirements
- Technology stack preferences
- User experience considerations
- Performance and scalability needs
- Integration requirements

**Ineffective Prompts Lack:**

- Clear objectives
- Technical specifications
- Implementation details
- Success criteria
