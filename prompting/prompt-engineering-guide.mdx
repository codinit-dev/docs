Learn how to ask the AI for what you want in a way that gets you the best results. CodinIT uses sophisticated system prompts that guide the AI's behavior, and understanding how to work with these prompts will help you get better results.

## How CodinIT Processes Your Requests

CodinIT uses different system prompts depending on the mode and settings you choose:

- **Build Mode**: Uses either the default, fine-tuned, or experimental prompt to generate code and implement features
- **Discussion Mode**: Uses a specialized consultant prompt focused on planning and guidance
- **Chain of Thought**: The AI shows its reasoning process before providing solutions
- **Search Grounding**: Automatically searches the web for current information when needed

Different AI models are good at different things. The key is to be clear about what you want and provide sufficient context.

## Tell the AI What Tools to Use

### Be Specific About Your Tools

CodinIT's system prompts include built-in preferences (like using Vite for web servers and Supabase for databases), but you can override these by being explicit. The AI works better when you tell it exactly what tools and technologies you want to use.

**Good example:**

```
Build an online store dashboard with:
- React for the website
- Supabase for saving data
- Tailwind CSS to make it look nice
- React Router to move between pages
```

### Built-in Technology Preferences

CodinIT has default preferences configured in its system prompts:

- **Web servers**: Vite (default)
- **Databases**: Supabase (default), or JavaScript-based alternatives like libsql or sqlite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Images**: Pexels stock photos (direct URLs only)
- **Package management**: npm
- **Node.js scripts**: Preferred over shell scripts

You can override these by explicitly specifying different tools in your prompts.

### Popular Tool Combinations

| What You're Building | Good Tools to Use | What It's For |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Website** | React + TypeScript | Making interactive websites |
| **Styling**            | Tailwind CSS       | Making things look pretty |
| **Saving Data**            | Supabase           | Storing user information      |
| **Managing Data**   | Zustand            | Keeping track of app information    |

### Tips for Different Frameworks

**If you're using React:**
- Say if you want modern or old-style components
- Mention how you want to handle data
- Tell it how pages should connect

**If you're using Vue:**
- Specify which Vue style you prefer
- Mention any UI libraries you like
- Say what build tool you're using

**For the Backend:**
- Say if you want REST or GraphQL APIs
- Mention if you need user login
- Tell it how to check if data is correct

## How to Ask Better Questions

### Give the AI Context

**Help the AI understand your situation:**

- Show it code you already have
- Tell it which files you're working on
- Mention any limits (like "needs to work on old phones")
- Say if speed is important

**Start Simple, Then Add Details:**

- First, explain what you want in general
- Then add more specific details
- Ask follow-up questions if needed
- Build on what the AI already created

### Tips for Different AI Models

**For Claude or Gemini:**

- Give all the information at once
- Use numbered lists to organize your thoughts
- Include examples of what you want
- Say how you want the answer formatted

**For GPT:**

- Break big requests into smaller pieces
- Use simple, clear language
- Show examples of what you mean
- Be specific about what you want

### Avoid Common Mistakes

**Don't do this:**

- Be too vague ("make it better")
- Forget to mention important details
- Use different names for the same thing
- Forget to say how things should connect

**Do this instead:**

- Include clear goals ("make the button blue and centered")
- Specify what success looks like
- Say how you'll test it
- Ask for checkpoints along the way

## Quick Tips Summary

### The Main Rules

1. **Be clear**: Say exactly what you want and how it should work
2. **Name your tools**: Tell the AI which technologies to use
3. **Give context**: Share relevant information and any limits
4. **Start simple**: Begin with basics, then add details

### Checklist Before You Ask

**Before you send your request:**

- ✅ You clearly explained your goal
- ✅ You listed the tools you want to use
- ✅ You mentioned the main features you need
- ✅ You described what success looks like

**While building:**

- 🔄 Give feedback on what the AI creates
- 🔄 Ask for specific changes
- 🔄 Request explanations if confused
- 🔄 Use discussion mode to plan

### What Makes a Good Request

**Good requests have:**

- Clear description of what you want
- List of tools to use
- How it should look and feel
- Any speed or size requirements
- How it connects to other things

**Bad requests are missing:**

- A clear goal
- Technical details
- Specific instructions
- Definition of "done"
