Learn how to ask the AI for what you want in a way that gets you the best results. Think of it like giving clear instructions to a helpful assistant.

## How AI Understands You

Different AI models are good at different things. The key is to be clear about what you want, just like explaining something to a friend.

## Tell the AI What Tools to Use

### Be Specific About Your Tools

The AI works better when you tell it exactly what tools and technologies you want to use. It's like telling a chef what ingredients to cook with.

**Good example:**

```
Build an online store dashboard with:
- React for the website
- Supabase for saving data
- Tailwind CSS to make it look nice
- React Router to move between pages
```

### Popular Tool Combinations

| What You're Building | Good Tools to Use | What It's For |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Website** | React + TypeScript | Making interactive websites |
| **Styling**            | Tailwind CSS       | Making things look pretty |
| **Saving Data**            | Supabase           | Storing user information      |
| **Managing Data**   | Zustand            | Keeping track of app information    |

### Tips for Different Frameworks

**If you're using React:**
- Say if you want modern or old-style components
- Mention how you want to handle data
- Tell it how pages should connect

**If you're using Vue:**
- Specify which Vue style you prefer
- Mention any UI libraries you like
- Say what build tool you're using

**For the Backend:**
- Say if you want REST or GraphQL APIs
- Mention if you need user login
- Tell it how to check if data is correct

## How to Ask Better Questions

### Give the AI Context

**Help the AI understand your situation:**

- Show it code you already have
- Tell it which files you're working on
- Mention any limits (like "needs to work on old phones")
- Say if speed is important

**Start Simple, Then Add Details:**

- First, explain what you want in general
- Then add more specific details
- Ask follow-up questions if needed
- Build on what the AI already created

### Tips for Different AI Models

**For Claude or Gemini:**

- Give all the information at once
- Use numbered lists to organize your thoughts
- Include examples of what you want
- Say how you want the answer formatted

**For GPT:**

- Break big requests into smaller pieces
- Use simple, clear language
- Show examples of what you mean
- Be specific about what you want

### Avoid Common Mistakes

**Don't do this:**

- Be too vague ("make it better")
- Forget to mention important details
- Use different names for the same thing
- Forget to say how things should connect

**Do this instead:**

- Include clear goals ("make the button blue and centered")
- Specify what success looks like
- Say how you'll test it
- Ask for checkpoints along the way

## AI prompt engineering best practices summary

### Essential AI prompting principles for code generation

1. **Clarity first**: Be specific about what you want to build with AI code generation and how it should work
2. **Technology specification**: Clearly state your preferred frameworks and libraries for LLM understanding
3. **Context provision**: Include relevant background information and constraints for better AI results
4. **Iterative AI approach**: Start simple, then add complexity through follow-up prompts for optimal code generation

### AI code generation quality checklist

**Before submitting AI prompts:**

- ✅ Goal is clearly defined for LLM understanding
- ✅ Technology stack is specified for AI code generation
- ✅ Key features are listed for comprehensive AI development
- ✅ User requirements are outlined for accurate LLM results
- ✅ Success criteria are defined for measurable AI outcomes

**During AI-powered development:**

- 🔄 Provide feedback on AI-generated code for improvement
- 🔄 Request specific modifications from LLM for refinement
- 🔄 Ask for AI explanations when needed for understanding
- 🔄 Use AI discussion mode for architecture planning

### Common Success Patterns

**Effective Prompts Include:**

- Specific functionality requirements
- Technology stack preferences
- User experience considerations
- Performance and scalability needs
- Integration requirements

**Ineffective Prompts Lack:**

- Clear objectives
- Technical specifications
- Implementation details
- Success criteria

  **Remember**: LLMs can only generate code based on the information you provide in prompts. The more specific and complete your AI prompts, the better the code generation results and AI-powered development outcomes.
