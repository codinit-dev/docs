CodinIT AI coding assistant needs an LLM (Large Language Model) to understand your requests and generate code. Think of it like choosing which AI expert to work with - different AI models have different coding strengths, performance, and costs.

## Quick start: Choose your AI coding model

The easiest way to get started with AI code generation is with **CodinIT** as your LLM provider:

1. **Open AI settings**: Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner of CodinIT's AI chat interface
2. **Select "CodinIT"** from the AI Provider dropdown for instant LLM access
3. **Choose an AI model** from the dropdown - we recommend starting with **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** or **DeepSeek V3** for code generation


**That's it!** No API keys to manage, and you'll get access to multiple AI coding models for intelligent development.

<Tip>
**Free AI coding models available**: CodinIT occasionally offers free LLM inferencing through partner providers. When available, you'll see these AI code generation options in your model dropdown.
</Tip>

## Alternative: Use your own AI model provider

If you prefer to use your own LLM API keys for AI code generation, you can select from providers like:

- **OpenRouter** - Great value, multiple AI coding models
- **Anthropic** - Direct access to Claude AI models for code generation
- **OpenAI** - Access to GPT-4 and GPT-4o for AI-powered development
- **Google Gemini** - Google's AI models for intelligent coding assistance
- **Ollama** - Run open-source LLMs locally on your computer for private AI coding

After selecting an AI provider, you'll need to:
1. Get an API key from their LLM provider website
2. Paste it into the API Key field in CodinIT AI settings
3. Choose your preferred AI coding model

<Note>
Most providers require payment information before generating API keys.
</Note>

## Which Model Should I Choose?

If you're just getting started, we recommend:

| Your Priority | Choose This Model | Why |
|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Reliability** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Most reliable for coding tasks |
| **Value** | DeepSeek V3 | Great performance at low cost |
| **Speed** | Qwen3 Coder | Fast responses |
| **Privacy** | Any Ollama model | Runs on your computer |

You can switch models anytime without losing your conversation.

## Next Steps

With your model configured, you're all set! In the next section, we'll walk you through completing your first task with CodinIT and show you how to interact with the AI to write, debug, and refactor code.
