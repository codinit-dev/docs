CodinIT AI coding assistant needs an LLM (Large Language Model) to understand your requests and generate code. Think of it like choosing which AI expert to work with - different AI models have different coding strengths, performance, and costs.

## Quick start: Choose your AI coding model

The easiest way to get started with AI code generation is with **CodinIT** as your LLM provider:

1. **Open AI settings**: Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner of CodinIT's AI chat interface
2. **Select "CodinIT"** from the AI Provider dropdown for instant LLM access
3. **Choose an AI model** from the dropdown - we recommend starting with **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** or **DeepSeek V3** for code generation


**That's it!** No API keys to manage, and you'll get access to multiple AI coding models for intelligent development.

<Tip>
**Free AI coding models available**: CodinIT occasionally offers free LLM inferencing through partner providers. When available, you'll see these AI code generation options in your model dropdown.
</Tip>

## Alternative: Use your own AI model provider

If you prefer to use your own LLM API keys for AI code generation, you can select from providers like:

- **OpenRouter** - Great value, multiple AI coding models
- **Anthropic** - Direct access to Claude AI models for code generation
- **OpenAI** - Access to GPT-4 and GPT-4o for AI-powered development
- **Google Gemini** - Google's AI models for intelligent coding assistance
- **Ollama** - Run open-source LLMs locally on your computer for private AI coding

After selecting an AI provider, you'll need to:
1. Get an API key from their LLM provider website
2. Paste it into the API Key field in CodinIT AI settings
3. Choose your preferred AI coding model

<Note>
Most providers require payment information before generating API keys.
</Note>

## Which AI coding model should I choose?

If you're just getting started with AI code generation, we recommend:

| Your Priority | Choose This AI Model | Why |
|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Reliability** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Most reliable LLM for AI coding tasks and code generation |
| **Value** | DeepSeek V3 | Great AI performance at low cost for budget-conscious developers |
| **Speed** | Qwen3 Coder | Fast LLM responses for real-time AI code completion |
| **Privacy** | Any Ollama model | Runs locally on your computer for private AI development |

You can switch AI models anytime without losing your coding conversation or context.

## Next steps for AI-powered coding

With your AI model configured, you're all set for AI code generation! In the next section, we'll walk you through completing your first AI-powered development task with CodinIT and show you how to interact with the LLM to write, debug, and refactor code intelligently.
