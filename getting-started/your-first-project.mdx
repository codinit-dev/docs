Ready to experience CodinIT's full development workflow? This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through building a modern task management application with React, Supabase database integration, and deployment to production.

By the end of this guide, you'll have created a professional web application and learned how to use CodinIT's advanced features including discussion mode, database integration, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- **CodinIT installed** in your editor [Install Guide](/getting-started/installation)
- **AI provider configured** [Model Setup](/getting-started/select-your-model)
- **Supabase account** (free tier available) [Supabase Setup](/integrations/supabase)
- **GitHub account** (for deployment) [Git Setup](/integrations/git)

## Step 1: Plan Your Application

Start by using **Discussion Mode** to plan your application architecture:

1. Click the **"Discuss"** button in the chat interface
2. Enter this planning prompt:

```
I want to build a task management application with the following features:
- User authentication (sign up/login)
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Database storage with Supabase
- Deploy to Vercel

What architecture would you recommend? Should I use React with TypeScript? What database schema makes sense?
```

**What happens:** CodinIT will analyze your requirements and provide architectural recommendations, technology suggestions, and a development roadmap.

## Step 2: Set Up the Project

Based on the discussion, start building:

```
Create a modern task management application with:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for database and authentication
- Clean, professional UI

Start with the basic project structure and authentication setup.
```

**What CodinIT creates:**

- Modern React application with TypeScript
- Vite build configuration
- Tailwind CSS setup
- Supabase client configuration
- Basic project structure with components

## Step 3: Connect to Supabase

Set up your database connection:

```
Connect to Supabase in the chat box
```

When prompted, provide your Supabase URL and anon key. CodinIT will:

- Configure environment variables
- Set up the Supabase client
- Create database connection utilities

## Step 4: Build Authentication

Add user authentication:

```
Add user authentication with Supabase:
- Sign up form with email/password
- Login form
- Password reset functionality
- Protected routes
- User session management
```

**Features added:**

- Authentication components
- Route protection
- User context and hooks
- Login/logout functionality

## Step 5: Create Database Schema

Design and implement the database:

```
Create a tasks table in Supabase with:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- title (text, required)
- description (text, optional)
- completed (boolean, default false)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key to auth.users)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

Include Row Level Security policies for user data protection.
```

**What gets created:**

- Database migration files
- TypeScript types for the schema
- RLS policies for data security
- Database utility functions

## Step 6: Build Task Management

Implement the core functionality:

```
Create task management features:
- Task list component showing all user tasks
- Add new task form with title and description
- Edit existing tasks inline
- Delete tasks with confirmation
- Toggle task completion status
- Filter tasks by completion status
```

**Components created:**

- Task list with real-time updates
- Task form components
- Task item components with actions
- State management for tasks

## Step 7: Add Real-time Updates

Enable live synchronization:

```
Add real-time subscriptions for tasks:
- Live updates when tasks are added/modified/deleted
- Real-time completion status updates
- Instant synchronization across browser tabs
- Optimistic UI updates
```

**Real-time features:**

- Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Live task updates
- Conflict resolution
- Offline support considerations

## Step 8: Polish the UI

Enhance the user experience:

```
Improve the UI with:
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty states for no tasks
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional color scheme and typography
- Accessibility features
```

**UI enhancements:**

- Mobile-responsive layouts
- Loading skeletons
- Error boundaries
- Toast notifications
- Keyboard navigation

## Step 9: Deploy to Production

Launch your application:

```
Deploy to Vercel
```

**Deployment process:**

- Automatic build configuration
- Environment variable setup
- Custom domain configuration (optional)
- Production optimization

## Step 10: Test and Iterate

Your application is now live! Test all features and make improvements:

```
Add a dark mode toggle to the application
```

or

```
Add task categories/tags for better organization
```

**Iteration tips:**

- Test user authentication flows
- Verify database operations
- Check responsive design
- Validate real-time updates
- Monitor performance

<Tip>
  **You've now learned:** - Discussion mode for project planning - Modern React development with TypeScript - Supabase
  database integration and RLS - Real-time data synchronization - Professional UI development - Production deployment
  workflows - Iterative development and testing
</Tip>
